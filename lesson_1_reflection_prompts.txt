How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Quicker than average, but still annoying without the proper visual aids.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily spot the types of changes that happened throughout the building
    of the code. These changes affect in different ways, that I can identify.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To save the embarrasing of looking for changes in the same variable but in
    different files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    The git log gives me the ID and description of every change made, while git
    diff shows me on detail those changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Giving the ID boosts the speed of finding an error.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Creating personal projects.
